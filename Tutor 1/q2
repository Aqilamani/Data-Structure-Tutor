/* (1) Performs Person's tasks
   (2) Invoke Employee's overloaded constructor
   (3) Performs Employee's tasks 
   (4) Performs Faculty's tasks 
   Explaination: Firstly Faculty class extends to employee and Employee class extends to person class 
                 Person class will be executed first and return to employee class to be executed next.
                 Faculty class will be executed lastly*/
